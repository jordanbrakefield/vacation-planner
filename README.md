<h1>How to operate Vacation Planner: </h1>

When you open the application, you will be greeted by the home screen.



Once you click the "get started" button, you are taken to the Vacation list screen. The first time this screen is viewed, the list will be empty. To add a new vacation, the user will click on the square button with a plus sign in the bottom right of the screen. The page that opens is the page where the user will enter in their new vacation. The details include the vacation name, the hotel name, the date that the vacation will begin and the date that the vacation will end.



After vacation info has been entered, the user will click on the menu items button in the top right of the screen and push "Save Vacation", the user will then be re-routed back to the vacation List screen where they can see their updated list of vacations. If the user noticed that they entered something into the vacation that was wrong, they can view the vacation details again by tapping on their vacation in the vacation list, changing their vacation information and tapping on the menu items to save the vacation again. This will update the vacation information. Also take note that in the vacation details menu item dropdown, there is an option to delete the vacation (if there aren't any excursions associated with it). There is an option to set a notification (Notify) that alerts the user on the day that their vacation is starting and ending. And there is an option to share the vacation (Share), which will copy all of the vacation (and excursion) information so that the user can send it via text, email etc.



If the user wants to add an excursion to their vacation, they will navigate to the vacation details page of the vacation that they want to add the excursion to and then tap on the square button with a plus sign in the bottom right.



Here they will fill in the excursion title and excursion date. Then they will click on the menu item button in the top right, just like on the vacation details page, and push "Save Excursion" to save the excursion info. Similar to the vacation details page, the excursion details Menu items provide an option to update the excursion in the same way that the vacation was updated, delete the excursion or set a notification that alerts the user on the day of the excursion.

After the user is done scheduling their vacations, the user is routed back to the Vacation List page where they have the option to tap on the menu item drop-down in the top right corner and select “Reports”. On the reports page that opens, the user can select a date through the date picker and receive a report that shows the vacation title and the hotel name of any vacation they have scheduled for that day.
